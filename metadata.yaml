description: "An Englishman Looks at the World is a 1914 essay collection by H. G.\
  \ Wells containing journalistic pieces written between 1909 and 1914. The book consists\
  \ of twenty-six pieces ranging from five to sixty-two pages in length. An American\
  \ edition was published the same year by Harper and Brothers under the title Social\
  \ Forces in England and America.\nWells organized the essays thematically, inserting\
  \ a fanciful \"synopsis\" after the table of contents conveying his view that the\
  \ book constituted an argument: \"Blériot arrives and sets him thinking. (1) He\
  \ flies, (2) and deduces certain consequences of cheap travel. (3) He considers\
  \ the King, and speculates on the New Epoch; (4) he thinks Imperially, (5) and then,\
  \ coming to details, about Labour, (6) Socialism, (7) and Modern Warfare. (8) He\
  \ discourses on the Modern Novel, (9) and the Public Library; (10) criticises Chesterton,\
  \ Belloc, (11) and Sir Thomas More, (12) and deals with the London Traffic Problem\
  \ as a Socialist should. (13) He doubts the existence of Sociology, (14) discusses\
  \ Divorce, (15) Schoolmasters, (16) Motherhood, (17) Doctors, (18) and Specialisation;\
  \ (19) questions if there is a People, (20) and diagnoses the Political Disease\
  \ of Our Times. (21) He then speculates upon the future of the American Population,\
  \ (22) considers a possible set-back to civilisation, (23) the Ideal Citizen, (24)\
  \ the still undeveloped possibilities of Science, (25), and—in the broadest spirit—the\
  \ Human Adventure. (26)\"\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
